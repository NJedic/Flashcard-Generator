# Flashcard-Generator

Use this super awesome CLI app to build and retrieve flash cards for studying purposes.

Simply choose "Create a Card" to create your deck and use "Study My Cards" to review them. 

The "Study My Cards" function will show you your cards one by one, prompting you for the answer, congratulating you if you're correct and and informing you of the correct one if your answer is incorrect.
