# Flashcard-Generator

Use this super awesome CLI app to build and retrieve flash cards for studying purposes.

Simply choose "Create a Card" to start creating your deck. The function will prompt you for both the question and its answer that you'd like to review!  

The "Study My Cards" function will show you your cards one by one, prompting you for the answer, congratulating you if you're correct and and informing you of the correct one if your answer is incorrect. 

Check out the package.json file for all of your necessary dependencies.

** PRO TIP: if you want to learn more about Harry Potter's Hufflepuff House, build a deck using the suggested questions in the cardOptions.js file - you're bound to gain some knowledge!
